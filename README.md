# TokoApp
This is the result of following the `Programming Phoenix 14` book. I decided to change some stuff since I planned to build something out of this.

## Running
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Todo
